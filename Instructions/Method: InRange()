[Boolean] = objVar.InRange([Time to test], [Start time], [End time])

This method will evaluate a string time value to determine if it falls between the start time and end time.

Eg,

Debug.Print objVar.InRange("0915", "0800", "1600")
-> True

Debug.Print objVar.InRange("02:15 P", "02:30 P", "04:00 P")
-> False

NOTE: The evaluated time value will return true if it matches the start time. However, it wil return false if it matches the end time. Think about it.
