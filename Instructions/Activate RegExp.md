To use this class module, you need to activate regular expressions (RegExp) in the excel file.

1. Open your Excel project and press Alt+F11 to go to the VBA editor.

2. Go to Tools -> References.

3. Now, you will see references to the VBA Project. Scroll down and select "Microsoft VBScript Regular Expression 5.0" or higher.

4. Now click on "OK" and save your project.

NOTE: This activates RegExp for this project workbook only. You need to do this again for any other project you create and in which you use <code>clsTimeAsString.cls</code>.
