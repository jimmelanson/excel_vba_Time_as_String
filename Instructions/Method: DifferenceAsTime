[String] = objVar.DifferenceAsTime([First time value], [Second time value])

Where the AddTimeValue() and SubtractTimeValue() methods give you a new clock time, this method gives you
a duration as a string formatted hh:mm, regardless of your selected time format.

Eg,

Debug.Print objVar.DifferenceAsSingle("02:05 P", "10:00 P")
-> 07:55

NOTE: The input is calculated in 24-Hour format. This means that it converts your input value to 24-Hour format
automatically. If you are using 12-Hour format for your inputs, make sure that you add an AM or PM to your
input time value.

NOTE: If your input times are identical (24-Hours apart), this method will return this as 00:00.
