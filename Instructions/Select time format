After declaring your object, you then have to select the time format you want for output. If you don't
indicate a format, the default value is 24-hour format.

objVar.TimeFormat = "24"
objVar.TimeFormat = "12"
objVar.TimeFormat = "French"

The three native outputs are:
- 24-Hour (military time: 2330)
- 12-Hour (standard time with colon: 11:00)
- French (This is the 24-Hour format with the hours and minutes separated by a lowercase letter "h" like: 23h30)

The fourth time format is a combination of the 12-Hour format and the AMPM flag being tured on.

eg:
  Dim objVar as New clsTimeAsString
  objVar.TimeFormat = "12"
  objVar.AMPM = True
  Debug.Print objVar.FormatTimeValue("2330")
  
  -> 11:00 P
