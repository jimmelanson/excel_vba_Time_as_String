objVar.TimeFormat = "12|24|French"

After declaring your object, you then have to select the time format you want for output. If you don't
indicate a format, the default value is 24-hour format.

The three defined outputs are:

objVar.TimeFormat = "24"
    »Military time. No seperator. No AM or PM.
    
objVar.TimeFormat = "12"
    »12-Hour format, hours reset to 1 after noon. There is a colon seperator. No AM or PM.
        
objVar.TimeFormat = "French"
    »24-hour format with the letter "h" between the hours and minutes. No AM or PM.

The fourth time format is a combination of the 12-Hour format and the AMPM flag being tured on.
The AMPM flag is ignored it the objVar.TimeFormat is not set to "12"

eg:
  Dim objVar as New clsTimeAsString
  objVar.TimeFormat = "12"
  objVar.AMPM = True
  Debug.Print objVar.FormatTimeValue("2330")
  
  -> 11:00 P
